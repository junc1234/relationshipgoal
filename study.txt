quantomEntanglement

I'm trying to create a system where to reflect the idea of quantomEntanglement within web space
the idea here is to infuse the idea of the six sense theory of human relationship with a mathematical equation.

*hypothesis code below here:

let frequency0 = X1;
let weight0 = Y1; 


    if (!quantumEntanglement) 
    {
        X1=X2,
        Y1=Y2,
    }
    else
    {
        X1=X1,
        Y1=Y2,

    };
        
const quantum0 = {
	name: "q0",
	shape: undefined,
    location: undefined,
    vRate: X1,
    weight: Y1,
	
};

const quantum1 = {
	name: "q1",
	shape: undefined,
    location: undefined,
    vRate: X,
    weight: Y,
	};

const quantomParticle = {
    name: string,
    state: string,
    description: string,
    coordinate: number, number, number,
    vFrequency: rate,
    speed: rate,
    weight: number,
    size: number,
    color: string,
    spatialProximity: relative,
    isEntangled:boolean,
};
